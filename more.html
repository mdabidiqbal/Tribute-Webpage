    <h3>Albert Einstein:A Brief Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist and one of 
        the most influential figures in the history of science. His groundbreaking contributions 
        revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and the nature of the universe. 
        Einstein's work laid the foundation for many modern technologies and has had a lasting impact on
         various fields, including physics, philosophy, and popular culture.
    </p>
    <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.</li>
            <li>He showed an early interest in science and mathematics, but struggled with
            formal education due to his rebellious nature and independent thinking.</li>
            <li>In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers on diverse topics, collectively 
            known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, which marked the beginning of his exceptional scientific career.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Special Theory of Relativity:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>n 1905, Einstein introduced the Special Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized 
            our understanding of time, space, and the relationship between matter and energy.</li>
            <li>The famous equation E=mc² emerged from his work, demonstrating the equivalence of mass and energy.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>General Theory of Relativity:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1915, Einstein formulated the General Theory of Relativity, which explained gravity as the curvature 
            of spacetime caused by massive objects.</li>
            <li>His theory predicted phenomena like gravitational waves, later confirmed by experiments.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Nobel Prize and Later Career:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, 
            which helped establish the quantum nature of light.</li>
            <li>Despite his groundbreaking contributions, he faced challenges in reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity, 
            leading to his quest for a unified theory.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Political and Social Involvement:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Einstein was not only a scientist but also an advocate for peace, civil rights, and social justice.</li>
            <li>He was a vocal critic of nuclear weapons and played a role in urging world leaders to use science for the betterment 
            of humanity.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Legacy:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Einstein's ideas have had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, with applications ranging from GPS 
            systems to black hole research.</li>
            <li>His theories continue to be tested and validated by ongoing scientific experiments and observations.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Passing and Continual Influence:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA.</li>
            <li>His work remains a cornerstone of modern physics, inspiring generations of scientists 
            and thinkers to explore the mysteries of the cosmos.</li>
        </ul>
